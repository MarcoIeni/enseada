# Enseada Web Dashboard

Enseada embeds a web dashboard for administration purposes.

The web dashboard is written in [VueJS 2](https://vuejs.org) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and
builds on the standard Enseada REST API and OAuth authentication.

## Quickstart

The simplest way to try it out is to start Enseada. The dashboard will be served from the root path.

Locally, it should be http://localhost:9623.

If you want to work on the source code it is recommended to start the project in watch mode. Head over to the [contribution guide](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for more informations.
