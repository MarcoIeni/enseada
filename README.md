>[!WARNING]
>Enseada is still under initial development. Some of the features and characteristics
>described in this document may still be missing.

Enseada is a modern, fast and scalable package registry, designed from the ground up to run in elastic, container-based environments and to be highly available and distributed.

It leverages scalability by using natively distributed technologies.

Check out the [official documentation](https://docs.enseada.io) for a complete manual of operation.

## Features

- [Multiple package repositories](#supported-package-repositories)
- [Multiple storage backends](#supported-storage-providers)
- Strong authentication based on [OAuth 2.0](https://auth0.com/docs/protocols/oauth2) tokens
- Flexible ACL engine to manage user permissions 
- Complete [management API](https://docs.enseada.io/developers/apis.html)
- CDN and caching friendly

The registry itself is written in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/), a fast, resource efficient and statically compiled programming language
built for safety and speed.

[CouchDB](https://couchdb.apache.org/) is used as the primary datastore, containing information about
repositories, users and access control. CouchDB is a web-native database written in Erlang and based on web technologies
like HTTP and JSON.

Enseada stores packages in distributed and fault-tolerant object storage services. See [Supported storage providers](#supported-storage-providers) for the
complete list.


## Supported package repositories

Enseada is a multi-package registry, meaning it can support a large number of package
formats and registry APIs.

At the moment, the following formats are supported:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/api/)
- [Maven 2/3](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-repositories.html)
- [NPM](https://github.com/npm/registry/blob/master/docs/REGISTRY-API.md) (planned, coming soon)
- [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org) (planned, coming soon)
- [Rust crates](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/registries.html) (planned, coming soon)
- [Go module proxy](https://docs.gomods.io/intro/protocol/) (planned, coming soon)

## Supported storage providers

The storage engine used by Enseada provides pluggable backends, allowing to easily support
multiple storage providers.
See the [configuration guide](https://docs.enseada.io/users/configuration.html) for how to setup the storage layer.

At the moment, the following providers are supported:

- S3 compatible (AWS S3, Minio, DigitalOcean Spaces, Scaleway Object Storage, Ceph, etc)

## HTTPS and HTTP/2 support

Enseada has full support for strict HTTPS, enabling it is very simple.

Passing the environment value `ENSEADA_TLS=true` will turn on
HTTPS on the entire application (with [HSTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security) enabled). This will require two
additional environment variables.

```.env
## The path to the key file
ENSEADA_TLS_KEY_PATH=nil

## The path to the certificate file
ENSEADA_TLS_CERT_PATH=nil
```

The private key must be either an RSA or PKCS8 key.
Both the certificate and the key must be in PEM format.

When HTTPS is active, Enseada switches automatically to [HTTP/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2) if supported
by the client.

## Build

Enseada is built as a statically linked executable.
However, it needs a few native libraries to build the executable, in particular libclang and LLVM. On Debian
they can be installed with `apt install build-essential llvm-dev libclang-dev`. These libraries are not needed to run the executable.
 
You need a stable build of the Rust compiler and standard library to build the binary. You can install one
using [rustup](https://rustup.rs).

Standard `cargo` commands work perfectly fine. For example, `cargo run` will compile and start the server.

Enseada is also packaged as a [Docker image](https://www.docker.com/r/enseada/enseada). Build one with `docker build -t myname/enseada:latest .`

## Web UI

Enseada comes with a management web UI. To build it from sources, NodeJS and Yarn are required.

Execute the following commands to build the static assets.

```bash
# Install all dependencies
yarn install

# Build and recompile on change for development (all stylesheets, no minification)
yarn watch

# Build for production (minimal stylesheets, minification, sourcemaps)
yarn build
```

Enseada will pick them up on its own.

## Local Database

A local CouchDB instance can be started using the provided [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml) file.
Simply run `docker-compose up -d` to start it in background, it will be available on `http://localhost:5984` and will
persist data in a Docker volume.

Upon first run, the database server is uninitialized. Please run the initialization setup for 
single node deployment by visiting http://localhost:5984/_utils/#setup and following the instructions.

## Local Minio Server

A local [Minio](https://minio.io) server can be started using the provided [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml) file.
Simply run `docker-compose up -d` to start it in background, it will be available on `http://localhost:9000` and will
persist data in a Docker volume.

Upon first run no bucket is present. Create a new one and configure the name in the appropriate environment variable 
in the Enseada configuration.

## Security Policy
